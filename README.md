# Jonathan's Personal Website
Welcome to my github page 

About Me:
I am at the Univeristy of Liverpool and I am working as a trainee Penetration Tester. I am very eager to learn about anything Cyber whether it be recent data breaches or new exploits which have been found in common applications such as Microsoft products.

I am hoping to use this website to showcase some fo my projects such as Writeups and some Univeristy programming work.
